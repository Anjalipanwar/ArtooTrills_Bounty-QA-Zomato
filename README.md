Here is the my work done. I could not complete due to time constraint. Hope you understand this.
 
Please find the following attachments: 
 
1. Excel spreadsheet containing few sample  test case examples on Zomato website. 
     The test cases are written on the bases of functionality.
 
2. Few mockup screen sample of Zomato Mobile App. 
     Note : Focused on look and feel of UI. 
 
As per given constraints, there are few suggestion through which a mobile app can be user friendly with less educated people.
     1. Use of intuitive Icons
     2. minimal page navigation
     3. Flexibility to switch to multiple languages like hindi, english etc.
     4. Tour Guide or help video in Help/Settings section
 
For less internet consumption,
     1. Use of less images , always ask to load or view full image. 
     2. Always ask to turn on GPS or auto detect location.
     3. Use white or default background , as it loads faster 
     4. Handle most of things Client Side 
     5. A backup of folder of application to cache information once searched/loaded.
 
 
3. For API Testing, we need tools like SOAP , Jmeter etc. Also, we need API keys. So, to do this manually, we can only trace the url navigations and responses.
 
Though, I have pulled request in Github but I was unable to attach spreadsheet so sending attachments with this mail.
 
 
Thanks !!
